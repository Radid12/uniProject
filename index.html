<p>Studio Ghibli, Inc. is a Japanese animation film studio based in Koganei, Tokyo, Japan. 
The studio is best known for its anime feature films, and has also produced several short films, television commercials, and one television film. 
It was founded on 15 June 1985, after the success of Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind (1984), with funding by Tokuma Shoten.</p>

<p>Eight of Studio Ghibli's films are among the 15 highest-grossing anime films made in Japan, with Spirited Away (2001) being the second highest, grossing over US$290 
million worldwide. Many of their works have won the Animage Anime Grand Prix award, and four have won the Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year. 
Five of Studio Ghibli's films have received Academy Award nominations. Spirited Away won the Golden Bear in 2002 and the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film in 2003. 
Totoro, a character from My Neighbor Totoro, is the studio's mascot.</p>

<h2>Studio Ghibli To Re-Open For Hayao Miyazaki's New Film</h2>
<!-- Info from 
https://www.empireonline.com/people/hayao-miyazaki/studio-ghibli-re-open-hayao-miyazaki-new-film/ -->
<p> While we were all sorry to hear that Studio Ghibli, the legendary animation company behind such films as My Neighbour Totoro, Howl's Moving Castle and Spirited Away
 was closing its doors for an indefinite hiatus, the Ghibli team never quite went away, working on TV projects, lending its name to other companies' films and even 
 planning for a theme park. And now comes some really good news: co-founder Hayao Miyazaki has decided to come out of retirement for a new project, and Ghibli will be 
 back in full production to support the feature film.</p>

<p>A little like Steven Soderbergh, Miyazaki himself didn't ever fully retire, instead spending his time on a short entitled Kemushi no Boro (Boro The Caterpillar) 
for the Ghibli museum. And, inspired by his work on that, he had announced that he intended to turn the project into a full-length animated movie.</p>

<p>As part of a small ceremony in July, Miyazaki brought together some of the main people 
involved in the film to talk about the idea, with the studio starting to recruit artists later that month. Training for new arrivals will 
kick off in October and the film should properly be in production a few months after that. There's no official confirmation that the new project will be the 
full-length version of Boro, but we're just happy that he and his company are back to weave their particular magic on screens.</p>

<h2>Sprited Away</h2>
<!-- Info from 
https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/sep/12/spirited-away-review -->
<p>Magical is a word used casually about films like this, films about fantasy and childhood. Yet this one really does deserve it: an enchanted and enchanting feature from the Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki which left me feeling lighter than air. It is a beautifully drawn and wonderfully composed 
work of art - really, no other description will do - which takes us on a rocket-fuelled flight of fancy, with tenderly and shrewdly conceived characters on board.<a href="page1.html">Continue the the full article</a></p>
<h2>Princess Mononoke</h2>
<!-- Info from 
https://www.empireonline.com/movies/princess-mononoke/review/ -->

<p>It cost $20 million to make, took $50 million in its first 12 days on domestic release, eventually grossed $157 million, and, in doing so, overtook E.T. 
to set an all-time Japanese box office record. It stars the vocal talents of a superb ensemble cast (see above). Its English dub was written 
by cult comic scribe, Neil Gaiman. And it's been described as one of the best animated films ever. Hell, Disney 
were so impressed, they bought the entire output of the studio that made it, Studio Ghibli, for worldwide distribution. And, chances are, you've never even heard of it.<a href="page2.html">Continue the the full article</a></p>
